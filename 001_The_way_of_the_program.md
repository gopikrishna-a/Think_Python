### The Python programming language


#### What is Python?
Ans: Python is an example of a high-level language, Other high-level languages are C, C++, Perl, and Java.
There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “assembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in lowlevel languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
