### The Python programming language


#### What is Python?
**Ans:** Python is an example of a high-level language, Other high-level languages are C, C++, Perl, and Java.
There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “assembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in lowlevel languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.

The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.


#### Interpreter and Compiler

+ Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:

#### Interpreter

**Ans:** An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. Figure 1.1 shows the structure of an interpreter.

#### Compiler

**Ans:** A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this context, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of a compiler.

**Note:** Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs are executed by an interpreter.
