# Variables, expressions and statements

#### 6. Variables

**Ans:** One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.
An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:

**Examples: Creating Variables** 

     message = 'And now for something completely different'  #string
     n = 17    #intiger
     pi = 3.1415926535897932   #float
    
**Note:** The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.


#### 6. What is State diagram?

**Ans:** A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to the variable’s value. This kind of figure is called a state diagram because it shows what
state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind).
