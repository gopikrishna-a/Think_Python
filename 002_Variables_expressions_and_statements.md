# Variables, expressions and statements

#### 6. Variables

**Ans:** One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.
An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:

**Examples: Creating Variables** 

     message = 'And now for something completely different'  #string
     n = 17    #intiger
     pi = 3.1415926535897932   #float
    
**Note:** The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.


#### 6. What is State diagram?

**Ans:** A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to the variable’s value. This kind of figure is called a state diagram because it shows what
state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind).

### 7. Variable names 

Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful—they document what the variable is used for.
Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter.

### keywords in Python
